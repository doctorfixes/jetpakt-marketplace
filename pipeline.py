"""
Denver Restaurant Reputation-Management Lead Pipeline
======================================================

Pipeline for identifying non-chain Denver restaurants with high-volume,
recent negative review signals and generating CRM-ready leads + personalized
outreach drafts.

Modules (each callable standalone for testing):

    fetch_candidates()      -> list[dict]   Pull from Google Maps public pages
    load_seed()             -> list[dict]   Hand-verified seed list (data/seed_candidates.json)
    score_sentiment(cand)   -> dict         Keyword + signal-strength score per candidate
    filter_qualified(cands) -> list[dict]   Removes chains, already-responding owners, etc.
    enrich_contacts(cand)   -> dict         Phone, website, Google review link verification
    generate_outreach(cand) -> dict         Subject + body, defamation-safe guardrails applied
    export_csv(cands, path) -> None         CRM-ready output

Usage:
    python pipeline.py --run         # Full pipeline, outputs CSV
    python pipeline.py --preview     # Show top 10 leads without exporting
    python pipeline.py --fetch-only  # Just run the Places fetcher

Safety guardrails (non-negotiable, baked in):
  - No individual names or staff identification in outreach copy.
  - Review quotes are VERBATIM from public sources — never paraphrased.
  - Wage / service-fee / billing complaints are flagged for human legal
    review before the message is sent (LEGAL_FLAGS set).
  - Outreach is DRAFTED, never auto-sent. Output CSV includes a
    `sent_status` column defaulted to "NOT_SENT — needs human review".
  - Candidates where the owner is already replying to negative reviews
    are deprioritized (they likely don't need the service).

I'm reaching out to the management team at {name}. I help Denver-area \
restaurants turn recent guest feedback into measurable operational wins — \
not by burying reviews, but by closing the loop on the two or three signals \
guests are actually asking you to address.

A quick look at {name}'s recent Google and Yelp activity surfaces one \
consistent theme: **{key_complaint}**. That's showing up in roughly {neg_pct}% \
of your last 30 days of reviews, which is well above the Denver market baseline.

A few things I'd offer — quickly and without a long sales pitch:

  1. A one-page Experience Enhancement read of the top 3 signals, each tied \
to verbatim public reviews (nothing invented).
  2. Drafted, defamation-safe response templates your team can send after \
every review — approved by you before going out.
  3. A 30-day tracking plan so you can see the complaint share move.

I'd love 15 minutes on the phone. Would {day_slot} work, or would you \
prefer I send a 2-page brief first?

Best,
[Your Name]

I've been studying how Denver restaurants are turning recent Google and \
Yelp signals into operational wins — not by burying reviews, but by \
closing the loop on the two or three things guests keep asking for.

I'd like to offer {name} a free, limited working version of what I do — \
a tailored one-page Experience Enhancement read, built from your own \
recent public reviews. No sales pitch attached. If it's useful, we can \
talk about what a fuller engagement looks like. If not, you keep the \
guide.

Here's what you'd get, free:

  • A ranked read of the top 3 guest-experience signals showing up in \
your last 30 days of Google and Yelp reviews
  • Each signal tied to verbatim public quotes — nothing invented
  • One drafted, defamation-safe response template per signal
  • A single-page PDF you can share with your GM or ownership group

To make it genuinely useful, I need 2–3 minutes of your input. Could \
you reply with the one or two areas where {name} is feeling the most \
pressure right now? A few common ones I hear from Denver operators:

  1. Service pacing at peak hours (ticket times, host handling, turns)
  2. Billing / service-charge transparency (the 15–22% fee conversation)
  3. Guest-recovery after a bad review — what to say, how fast, by whom
  4. Reservation and waitlist friction (special occasions, walk-ins)
  5. Consistency across shifts — the "Tuesday feels different from Saturday" problem
  6. Online review response cadence — volume is outpacing the team
  7. Staff training on specific moments (allergies, birthdays, large parties)

Just a quick reply — even one sentence — and I'll build the guide \
around the area that matters most to you. You'll have it in 48 hours.
