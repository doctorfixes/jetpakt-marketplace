JetPakt — Initial Outreach Builder (v3)

Template v3 rules (locked — per REPOSITION_V3_SPEC.md §5.1):
  - Drift-first framing. The first sentence names the review volume read and
    then asserts that the same operating signal is repeating, in ROS
    pillar + case terms. Reviews are the symptom; the pillar is the problem.
  - Subject: "A drift pattern in {short_name} reviews" (<= 45 chars).
  - Verbatim quote appears in paragraph one (quote as evidence of drift,
    not as the subject of the email).
  - Offer is the $49 Drift Diagnosis (Operator Memo) with a projected
    revenue-recovery range. Still binary reply (yes or silence).
  - Signature is two lines: identity + email + URL.
  - No em-dashes in author-generated body. Verbatim quotes may contain
    em-dashes; we prefer those without.
  - Legal-HIGH drafts still get the HB25 1090 heads-up paragraph.
  - The builder never names individual staff and never repeats blocked tokens
    (illness allegations, named individuals).

Output: a JSON manifest + one .md draft per target for local review,
plus the body fed into the Outlook connector for draft staging.
